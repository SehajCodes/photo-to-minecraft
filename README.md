# This python program replaces blocks of pixels with Minecraft blocks.
Project was developed and is intended to run in a Docker container. Haven't tested it in any major OS.

Extracted Minecraft blocks textures obtained from:

https://github.com/InventivetalentDev/minecraft-assets/tree/1.19.3/assets/minecraft/textures/block
(BIG SHOUT-OUT)


Filtered out all rectangular, animated, and alpha-value(transparency) containing textures.
Top, bottom, front, side, back and door textures are not filtered.
